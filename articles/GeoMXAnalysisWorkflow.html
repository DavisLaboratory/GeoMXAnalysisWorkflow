</h3>
<p>Nanostring’s GeoMx DSP data comes from the GeoMx DSP workflow which
integrates standard pathology and molecular profiling to obtain robust
and reproducible spatial multiomics data. DSP data typically comes from
whole tissue sections, FFPE or fresh frozen samples. These can be imaged
and stained for RNA or protein. The selected <code>regions</code> or
<code>areas</code> of interests will have their count expression levels
quantified using either the nCounter Analysis System or an Illumina
Sequencer.</p>
<p>GeoMx RNA assays allows quantitative and spatial measurements of
transcripts (up to the whole transcriptome) from single sections of FFPE
or fixed fresh frozen tissues. Typical gene panels utilised include the
Cancer Transcriptome Atlas (CTA, ~1800 genes) and Whole Transcriptome
Atlas (WTA, ~18000 genes).</p>
<p>Count data are generated from the DSP pipeline and technically
pre-processed using the GeoMx Data Analysis Suite (DSPDA). This includes
the removal of low performing probes and calculation of a typical QC
metric called LOQ using the negative probes. Data normalization is
typically conducted based on recommendations from Nanostring by the
technologist/technicians with a suggested Q3 normalized data output.</p>
<p><strong>Note: Q3-normalized data is not recommended for any
bioinformatics workflow or pipeline. Rather, the technical probe
corrected counts (probeQC, which accounts for any technical machine
systematic errors during the DSP run) is recommended.</strong></p>

</h3>
<p>A typical bioinformatics analysis of a GeoMx DSP dataset often starts
with a count table (from sequencing reads of genes for each region of
interest (ROI)), and ends with either identifying differential expressed
genes or performing gene signature/gene-set scoring pathway/enrichment
analyses in various conditions or experimental designs. Nevertheless,
before performing any differential expression (DE) analysis or other
downstream analyses that are based on the gene counts, proper quality
control(QC) and normalization of the data is essential and if not done
properly, will greatly impact the correctness and validity of the DE and
corresponding downstream analysis’ results. We therefore developed a
bioconductor package called <code>standR</code>
(<strong>S</strong>patial <strong>t</strong>ranscriptomics
<strong>a</strong>nalyzes a<strong>n</strong>d <strong>d</strong>ecoding
in <strong>R</strong>) to assist the QC, normalization and batch
correction of the GeoMx transcriptomics data.</p>
<p>There are three major advantages of using the <code>standR</code>
package to analyse the GeoMx DSP datasets:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The package uses the <code>SpatialExperiment</code>
infrastructure to analyse the data. This infrastructure is a lineage of
the <code>SummarisedExperiment</code> family, which is highly
recommended in the bioconductor community. It is compatible and
transferable with many other well developed packages in the RNA-seq
analysis world, such as <code>scater</code>, <code>scran</code>,
<code>edgeR</code> and <code>limma</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>The package features a comprehensive route for quality control,
and provides various visualisation functions to help in the assessment
of the various quality control metrics.</p></li>
<li><p>Batch effect is a common feature in transcriptomic datasets,
especially in GeoMx DSP data due to the way the slides are typically
utilised due to experimental constrains/designs. The package currently
provides three batch correction methods that will remove the unwanted
batch effect and provides statistics for assessing the correction
process and outcomes.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In this workshop, we will firstly use <code>standR</code> to process
and analyse a published GeoMx WTA dataset using the recommended
workflow. This will demonstrate our recommended workflow for processing
and analysing GeoMx transcriptomics datasets. Secondly, we will perform
DE analysis of the processed data using the <code>limma-voom</code>
pipeline, followed by a gene-set enrichment analysis using
<code>fry</code> and subsequent visualisation of the higher order
results using the R package <code>vissE</code>.</p>

<p>The data we are using in this workshop is a published GeoMx whole
transcriptome atlas (WTA) dataset of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) that
was made available by Nanostring (<a href="http://nanostring-public-share.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/GeoScriptHub/KidneyDataset/" class="external-link uri">http://nanostring-public-share.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/GeoScriptHub/KidneyDataset/</a>).</p>
<p>This dataset includes data on <strong>seven slides</strong>, which
includes <strong>4 DKD and 3 healthy</strong> slides. The ROI selection
strategy employed is a regional based approach focused primarily on two
distinct structures found in the kidney, namely: <strong>tubules or
glomeruli</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Glomeruli</em> ROIs were identified and curated by a pathologist
as either <strong>relatively healthy or diseased</strong> regardless of
the tissue type (DKD or healthy).  <em>Tubule</em> ROIs were segmented
into <strong>distal (PanCK positive) and proximal (PanCK
negative)</strong> tubules. Distal and proximal tubules are distinct in
terms of their differing functions in the kidney.</p>
<p>This GeoMx DSP data can be retrieved by querying the
<code>ExperimentHub</code> repository. The query below searches for all
objects in the hub associated with the search term “standR”.</p>

<p>As described in the introduction, there are many advantages to use a
mature infrastructure throughout the analysis, such as compatibility
with other tools.</p>
<p>Therefore, the first step in the <code>standR</code> package workflow
is to construct a <code>SpatialExperiment</code> object that includes
all the information available in the data. Here we can use the function
<code>readGeoMX</code> to do so. For more information about the
<code>SpatialExperiment</code> infrastructure, see <a href="http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SpatialExperiment.html" class="external-link">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note 1: By default, the <code>readGeoMx</code> function will
look for the gene name column in both the <code>countFile</code> and
<code>featureAnnoFile</code> with the column name of “TargetName”, and
the sample name column in the <code>sampleAnnoFile</code> with the
column name of “SegmentDisplayName”, these column names are given by the
Nanostring in the default settings, if your data have been modified, you
can indicate the corresponding column names by specifying the parameter
“colnames.as.rownames” in the <code>readGeoMx</code> function when
loading the data.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note 2: If you plan to use <code>readGeoMx</code> to
construct the <code>SpatialExperiment</code> object with your own data,
make sure that the files you use as inputs are tab-delimited
files.</strong></p>

is stored in the <code>counts</code> assay slot, while the log-CPM
(count per million) of the data is calculated by default with the

<p>The <code>readGeoMX</code> function has other parameters such as
<code>hasNegProbe</code> and <code>NegProbeName</code> that are designed
to deal with negative probes in the data. In CTA data, there is usually
one negative probe names “NegProbe”, and for WTA data, there could be
one or more negative probes with the same name “NegProbe-WTX”. By
default, the <code>readGeoMx</code> function will remove the negative
probe, the entry with name “NegProbe-WTX”, in the count table and put it
in the metadata of the object. User can turn this off by specifying
<code>hasNegProbe = FALSE</code> in the function, just make sure there
are no duplicate gene names in the “TargetName” column.</p>

<p>The recommended quality control (QC) checks for the GeoMx
transcriptome data consist of three major steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Inspection of the sample metadata</strong>: Sample
metadata can be view in tabular-like format using the
<code>colData</code> function, however here we aim to visualise the
relations across the various sample information, such as which slide did
the ROIs came from, which are the control groups and treatment groups,
what are the pre-defined tissue types etc. By doing this, we will have
an overview of how the experiment was designed, the potential questions
of interest, are there clear batch effects to look out for, and the
comparisons of interest that can be established.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Gene level QC</strong>: At the gene level, by default we
aim at removing genes that are not expressed in more than 90% of the
ROIs, and identifying any ROIs with very few genes being expressed. This
is similar to the process used in <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/edgeR/man/filterByExpr.html" class="external-link">edgeR::filterByExpr</a></code>, as
genes with consistently low counts are unlikely to be identified as
significant genes. By keeping only the genes with sufficiently large
counts in the analysis, we can increase the statistical power while
reducing multiple testing burden.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>ROI level QC</strong>: At the ROI level, we aim to
identify the low-quality ROIs that have small library size (i.e. total
feature count) and low cell count. These low-quality ROIs, if not
removed would show up as isolated clusters in the dimension reduction
plots (PCA/UMAPs) and thereby affect the comparisons conducted during DE
analyses.</p></li>
</ol>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="sample-level-qc">Sample level QC<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#sample-level-qc"></a>
</h4>
<p>To visualise sample metadata, we can use the
<code>plotSampleInfo</code> function. In this dataset, the following key
features are of interest for which we would like to look at: slides
(“SlideName”), diseases status (“disease_status”), tissue regions
(“region”), and the different cancer subtypes (“pathology”). These can
be queries by listing them in the function.</p>

<p>Based on the known sample information, we know that all the
<em>glomerulus</em> ROIs are classified as either abnormal or healthy,
and <em>tubule</em> are classified as PanCK negative(“neg”) or positive
(“PanCK”).</p>
<p>We therefore merge the region and segment/pathology related
annotations to avoid collinearity, which can cause problems when dealing
with batch correction. Specifically:</p>
<p>For <em>glomerulus</em>, “region” will concatenate with
“pathology”.</p>
<p>For <em>tubule</em>, “region” will concatenate with
“segmentLabel”.</p>

<p>Now we check on the gene level data. Using the
<code>addPerROIQC</code> function, we can add key statistics to the
<code>colData</code> of the object. For the purpose of this exercise, we
will set the argument <code>rm_genes</code> to TRUE, and keeping the
default settings of <code>min_count = 5</code> and
<code>sample_fraction = 0.9</code>. We first calculate the expression
threshold using the logCPM data (to account for library size
variations), we then filter out the genes with low-expression values
that’s below the set threshold in more than 90% of the ROIs.</p>

<p>Moreover, users can order the samples (using parameter
<code>ordannots</code>) or color/shape the dots by specific annotation
to better compare and assess for specific biological or experimental
factors which are influencing how these genes were expressed across the
samples (e.g. gene may be highly expressed in particular tissue types or
under particular treatment conditions. These genes are to be access or
curated by domain experts to ascertain or determine if any of these
genes are of biological/experimental significance. This provides a

<h4 id="roi-level-qc">ROI level QC<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#roi-level-qc"></a>
</h4>
<p>After checking the genes, we can now look at the ROI level data.
Using the <code>plotROIQC</code> function, we can visualise QC
statistics at the ROI level. By default, the library size and cell count
(AOINucleiCount) will be computed.</p>
<p>In the ROI level QC, we first aim to identify (if any) ROI(s) that
have relatively low library size and low cell count because they are
considered as low quality samples due to insufficient sequencing depth
or the lack of RNA in the selected region. Frequency histograms are also
provided for both library size and nuclei count to assist with assessing
any abnormal distributions of samples in the data.</p>
<p>In this case, we assess the distribution plot for library size
against the nuclei count. Looking at the scatter plot, we expect the
library sizes to be mostly positively correlated with the cell count
(i.e. nuclei count). It is not unexpected for there to be some ROIs
having relatively low library size and having a reasonable number of
cells (nuclei count). In this dataset, we see this library size vs cell
count relationship is relatively smooth with no aberrations observed
(e.g. spikes at the lower ranges)</p>
<p>To remove/filter low quality samples, we define a filtering threshold
near the lower end of the library size range, in this case at 50,000. By
stratifying (color) the points based on their slide names, we notice
that the ROIs below the threshold are all from slide <em>disease1B</em>
(pale orange). This might suggest potential of some technical errors
associated with slide <em>disease1B</em>.</p>

<p>In this experiment, based on the above plot, the library size
threshold of 50,000 looks to be a reasonable cutoff. As such we subset
the spatial experiment object based on the library size using this
threshold in <code>colData</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Note: The same workflow and logic can also be applied to the
nuclei count. We will also check the gene detection rate to assess the
quality of the dataset.</strong></p>
<p>The function <code>plotROIQC</code> is looking at nuclei count and
library size of each ROI by default. User can change the x or y axis to
any other statics they want to QC by specifying the parameter
<code>x_axis</code> or <code>y_axis</code>. For example, the statistics
limit of quantification (LOQ) is summarised by the Nanostring process
pipeline and it’s provided in most/all of the GeoMx DSP dataset. This
metrics is calculated based on the distribution of the negative probes,
and it’s suggested by Nanostring that LOQ can be useful when there are
large segments (i.e. big ROI or high cell count samples), and a minimum
LOQ of 2 is recommended.</p>

<p>After filtering, we will use function <code>plotRLExpr</code> to
visualise the relative log expression (RLE) of the data to identify any
technical variation that may be present in the dataset. We look at the
relative distance between the median of the RLE for each ROI (the dot in
the boxplot) to zero.</p>
<p>By default, we plot the RLE of the raw count, where we expect to see
majority of the variation to be contributed by differences in library
size.</p>

<p>By using <code>assay = 2</code> to run RLE on the logCPM data, we can
see that most of the technical variations due to library size
differences are removed.</p>
<p>We can follow up by sorting the data based on the different sample
metadata annotations by specifying the <code>ordannots</code> parameter.
This can be visualised either with color or shape mapping parameters
(based on similar approaches for plotting in <code>ggplot</code>),
enabling quick assessment of the possible factors that’s contributing to
the observed technical variation(s).</p>
<p>In this case, we stratify by <em>slideName</em> using different

well as to a lesser extent within each slide.</p>

<p>We can also look at the data by breaking it down into the lower

<p>Using the <code>drawPCA</code> function, we can perform principal
component analysis (PCA) on the data. The PCA can help visualise any
potential systemic variations (both biological and technical) in the
data and to identify the main factors contributing to the
variations.</p>
<p>Here we stratify the points based on slide information
(<em>SlideName</em> by color) and tissues regions (<em>regions</em>
using shapes). It is clear that tissue regions/types can be explained on
PC1, particularly between <em>glomerulus</em> and <em>tubule</em>. ROIs
group and clusters by the individual slide within each tissue structure.
Note that the subtypes in the <em>tubule</em> ROIs are are clearly
separated along PC2. This is not the case for the different subtypes of
glomerulus (which groups together).</p>

including TMM, RPKM, TPM, CPM, upperquartile and sizefactor. Among
these, RPKM and TPM require gene length information (add
<code>genelength</code> column to the <code>rowData</code> of the
object). For TMM, upperquartile and sizefactor, their normalized factor
will be stored in their <code>metadata</code>.</p>

<p>In the Nanostring’s GeoMx DSP protocol, each slide is typically only
able to fit a handful of tissue segments (Tissue microarrays/FFPE
cores), it is common that DSP data are confounded by the batch effect
introduced by the different slides. In order to establish appropriate
comparisons between the ROIs in the downstream analyses, it is necessary
to remove this batch effect from the data.</p>
<p>In the <code>standR</code> package, we provide two approaches for
removing batch effects (RUV4 and Limma), more methods (e.g. RUVg) are
included in the development version.</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="correction-method-remove-unwanted-variation-4-ruv4">Correction method : Remove Unwanted Variation 4 (RUV4)<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#correction-method-remove-unwanted-variation-4-ruv4"></a>
</h4>
<p>Remove Unwanted Variation 4 (RUV4) is a method developed by Terry
Speed and Johann Gagnon-Bartsch to use negative control genes to remove
unwanted variations, see the published paper <a href="https://academic.oup.com/biostatistics/article/13/3/539/248166" class="external-link">here</a>.</p>
<p>To run batch correction using RUV4, a list of “negative control genes
(NCGs)” will be required.</p>
<p><code>standR</code> provides a function <code>findNCGs</code> which
identify the NCGs from the data. In this case, since the batch effect is
mostly due to slide effects, we aim to identify NCGs across all the
slides. As such, the <code>batch_name</code> parameter was set to
“SlideName”, and the top 300 least variable genes (ranked by coefficient
of variation) across different slides were identified as NCGs. These are
stored in the object as “NCGs”.</p>

<p>Now we run RUV4 using the function <code>geomxBatchCorrection</code>.
By default this function will use <code>RUV4</code> to normalize the
data.</p>
<p>For RUV4 correction, the function requires 3 addition parameters
other than the input object:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>factors</code>: the factor of interest, i.e. the biological
variation to keep;</li>
<li>
<code>NCGs</code>: the list of negative control genes detected using
the function <code>findNCGs</code>;</li>
<li>
<code>k</code>: the number of unwanted factors to use. Based on
RUV’s documentation, it is suggest to use the smallest k possible where
the observed technical variation is no longer observed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Choosing the optimal k is one of the most important task when
performing batch correction using RUV. The best way to do so is to test
out each k and assess the corresponding diagnostic plot (e.g. PCA). The
optimal k would be the smallest value that produces a separation of the
main biology of interest of the experiment on a PCA plot.</p>
<p>So here we run through the paired PCA plots for k between 1 and
5.</p>
<p>In this case, we create a combined factor of interest
<em>biology</em> (concatenate <em>disease_status</em> and
<em>regions</em> information) in the object. This factor will be
specified in the <code>factors</code> parameter of the function.</p>

</h5>
<p>The typical approach to interrogating the effectiveness of batch
correction process on the data uses dimension reduction plots like PCAs.
Here we further suggest the use of summarized statistics to assess the
effectiveness of batch correction. The 6 summarized statistics tested in
this package includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adjusted rand index.<br>
</li>
<li>Jaccard similarity coefficient.<br>
</li>
<li>Silhouette coefficient.<br>
</li>
<li>Chi-squared coefficient.</li>
<li>Mirkin distance.<br>
</li>
<li>Simple matching coefficient.</li>
</ul>
<p>This assessment can be conducted by using the
<code>plotClusterEvalStats</code> function provided in
<code>standR</code>.</p>
<p>Here we present the output for the summarised statistics for the two
normalization methods in this workshop (i.e. RUV4 and Limma ) as well as
the uncorrected data. Scores for each method will be presented as a
barplot scores of the six summarized statistics (as above) under two
sections (<em>biology</em> and <em>batch</em>). As a general rule, for
the <em>biology</em> of interest defined in the batch correction
process, a higher score is considered a good outcome. On the other hand,
for the batch, a smaller score will be the preferred outcome.</p>
<p>We can see from the results that when it comes to stratifying based
on biological factors (disease status and tissue regions) or quantifying
the amount of clustering due to batch effects for this dataset,
<code>RUV4</code> outperforms <code>limma</code> in most cases.</p>

<p>In addition, we can visualize the outcomes using RLE plots of
normalized count to determine which batch correction performs better for
this dataset.</p>
<p>Plotting both the RLEs for RUV4-corrected and limma-corrected data,
we can clearly see that RUV4-corrected data has in general a
more-closer-to-zero median RLE when compared to that for the
limma-corrected data. Therefore, for the downstream differential
expression analysis, we would suggest using RUV4 as the batch correction
method for this specific dataset.</p>

</h2>
<p>For the downstream analyses such as differential expression analyses,
standR does not provide specific functions.</p>
<p>Instead, we recommend incorporating the workflow with well
established pipelines, such as <code>edgeR</code>,
<code>limma-voom</code> or <code>DESeq2</code>. These pipelines uses
linear modelling which borrow information from all genes, making it more
appropriate for complex dataset with various experimental factors. A
simple T-test is definitely not recommended for performing DE analysis
of GeoMx DSP data.</p>
<p>In this workshop, we’ll demonstrate the DE analysis using the
<code>limma-voom</code> pipeline.</p>
<p>We’ve shown in previous sections that for this dataset, using RUV4
with <code>k = 4</code> is the appropriate batch correction approach and
is able to remove the batch effect and other undesired technical
variations. To incorporate this correction into the linear model, we
need to include the weight matrix generated from the function
<code>geomxBatchCorrection</code> as covariates. The weight matrix can
be found in the <code>colData</code>.</p>

using the <code>DGElist</code> infrastructure. Our

<p>In our analysis, it is of interest to see which genes are
differential expressed in different tissue regions within different
status of the samples, a design matrix is therefore set up with both the
disease status (DKD and normal) and tissue regions (glomerulus_healthy,
glomerulus_abnormal, tubule_PanCK and tubule_neg) information. We added
the W matrices resulted from the <code>RUV4</code> to the model matrix
as covariates to use batch corrected data.</p>
<p>Recall we have created the factor <code>biology</code> earlier in the
workshop. This factor is an interacting factor of interest between
disease status and tissue regions. As such, we directly use this factor
in the design matrix.</p>

<p>In the <code>limma-voom</code> pipeline, linear modelling is carried
out on the log-CPM values by using the <code>voom</code>,
<code>lmFit</code>, <code>contrasts.fit</code> and <code>eBayes</code>
functions. In specific cases where users like to take more
considerations of the log fold changes in the statistical analysis, the
<code>treat</code> function is applied.</p>
<p><strong>Notes: If there are samples from a mixture of patients where
subsets of which will have come from each patient (individual), the
intra-and-inter patient correlations will need to be accounted for in
the modelling. To do this, it is recommended to use the
<code>duplicateCorrelation</code> function, followed by passing the
resulting correlation to the <code>lmFit</code> function.</strong></p>

</h2>
<p>For users who are interested in whether some specific genes are DE in
the contrast, you can extract them from the DE tables. However, if there
isn’t a specific list of genes, users can proceed to perform a gene sets
enrichment analysis (GSEA) to find out the enriched gene sets, which
might indicate relevant or interest biological patterns.</p>
<p>There are many ways to perform GSEA, here we try to do GSEA with the
DE genes using <code>fry</code> from the <code>limma</code> package.</p>
<p>We select the following gene sets to conduct gene set enrichment
analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li>MSigDB Hallmarks - genesets from the hallmarks collection of
MSigDB</li>
<li>MSigDB C2 - genesets from the C2 collection of MSigDB which contains
curated genesets such as those obtained from databases such as BioCarta,
KEGG, PID, and Reactome, and from chemical or genetic perturbation
experiments</li>
<li>GO BP - biological processes from the gene ontology database</li>
<li>GO MF - molecular functions from the gene ontology database</li>
<li>GO CC - cellular component from the gene ontolgoy database</li>
</ul>
<p>FDR &lt; 0.05 indicates significantly enriched gene set.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="load-gene-sets">Load Gene sets<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#load-gene-sets"></a>
</h3>
<p>We load the gene sets using the <code>msigdb</code> package, and
extact only the gene sets we described above. This might take a few
minutes to run.</p>

<p>The output is a <code>data.frame</code> object. We can either output
the whole table, or inspect the top 20 gene sets in a bar plot.</p>
<p>We can see glomerular-related gene sets such as
<em>glomerular_basement_membrane_development</em> and
<em>glomerular_epithelial_cell_differentiation</em> are significantly
enriched in up-regulated genes in abnormal glomerulus compared to tubule
neg. Diabetic-related pathways are also found to be enriched.</p>

<p>An alternative way to summarise the GSEA output is to visualise
common gene sets as a group.</p>
<p>We can use the <code>igraph</code> and <code>vissE</code> package to
perform clustering on the enriched gene sets and visualise the gene sets
using word cloud-based algorithm and network-based visualisation. For
more information about <code>vissE</code>, check out <a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/vissE.html" class="external-link">here</a>.</p>

<li><p>The network plot visualises gene sets as a network where nodes
are gene-sets and edges connect gene-sets that have genes in
common;</p></li>
<li><p>Gene statistic plots visualise a gene-specific statistic (a log
fold-change in this case) for all genes that belong to gene-sets in the
cluster against the number of gene-sets that gene belongs to.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Combined, these three plots enable users to identify higher-order
biological processes, characterise these processes (word-clouds), assess
the relationships between higher-order processes (network plot), and
relate the experiment-specific statistics back to the identified
processes (gene statistic plot), thereby providing an integrated view of
the data.</p>

<p>The analysis of the GeoMx transcriptomics data requires several steps
of quality control to ensure the data is of good quality for performing
downstream analyses like differential expression analysis with pipelines
such as <code>edgeR</code>, <code>limma-voom</code> or
<code>DEseq2</code>. The bioconductor package <code>standR</code>
provides multiple functions for conducting QC and normalization for the
GeoMx DSP datasets.</p>
